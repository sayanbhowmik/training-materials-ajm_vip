# Introduction to Electronic Structure Theory

This section will serve to introduce key concepts in electronic structure theory. This will include:
- Basic Linear Algebra
- Operators
- Basic Dirac notation
- Continuous Generalization of Linear Algebra
- Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
- Hamiltonians as Operators
- Schrodinger Equation and Eigenvalue Problems

This is currently just a placeholder. The goal will be to add this to the training materials by Fall 2024.
